How to use:
1. Click the Text Color, Background Color, or Link Color button. A border will appear around the button letting you know it's active.
2. Choose a color on the color wheel to change the color. You can see your changes dynamically.
3. Now, whenever you want to change the colors of a site, just hit the Change Colors button. This is a global toggle, so it will apply to all sites. You can also change colors via a right-click context menu.

You can also enable or disable Color Changer for specific subdomains with the Always or Never button.

What is a subdomain? For example, the subdomain in developer.mozilla.org is "developer". Most of the time, the subdomain will be "www".

Mousing over the gray bar at the bottom will open a flyout menu. To clear all saved colors and subdomains, click Clear Data. There also happens to be a donate button down there. :)

About the color wheel:
Colors are less saturated (more gray) near the center and 100% saturated (no gray) on the edge. There is a separate swatch to the side that says "0% Sat", meaning 0% saturation or 100% gray.

There is also a lightness slider below the color wheel. Lower tends to black, and higher tends to white.
