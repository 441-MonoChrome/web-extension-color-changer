Summary:
Some sites have good information, but display bad colors that make them hard to use or hurt your eyes. With this extension, you can change a page's text, background, and link colors to make it more accessible. This extension isn't meant to be a global themer for the web and will not work well on all sites. If you want a specific site to have a dark theme, for example, you'll probably want to use something else.

How to use:
When you first install the extension, please refresh any tabs you have open so that the CSS styles from the extension are loaded in the page.

1. Click the Text Color, Background Color, or Link Color button. A border will appear around the button letting you know it's active.
2. Choose a color on the color wheel to change the color. You can see your changes live.
3. Now, whenever you want to change the colors of a site, just hit the Change Colors button. You can also change colors via a right-click context menu.

You can also enable Color Changer for all pages on a host with the Always button. For example, if you visit a page on developer.mozilla.org, you can click the Always button and Color Changer will be applied to all pages under developer.mozilla.org.

Mousing over the gray bar at the bottom will open a flyout menu where you can click Clear Data, which will reset the extension's colors to defaults and clear any hosts you saved with the Always button.

About the color wheel:
Colors are less saturated (more gray) near the center and more saturated (less gray) on the edge. There is a separate swatch that says "Gray", meaning 100% gray.

The lightness slider is below the color wheel. Lower tends to black, higher tends to white.

This extension doesn't use Google Analytics.
