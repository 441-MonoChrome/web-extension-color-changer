How to use:
1. Click the Text Color, Background Color, or Link Color button. A border will appear around the button letting you know it's active.
2. Choose a color on the color wheel to change the color. You can see your changes dynamically.
3. Now, whenever you want to change the colors of a site, just hit the Change Colors button. You can also change colors via a right-click context menu.

If you'd like Color Changer to always change the colors for a subdomain, you can click Change Subdomain. Clicking again will make Color Changer forget that subdomain.

What is a subdomain? For example, in developer.mozilla.org, the subdomain is "developer". So whenever you visit any url that has developer.mozilla.org, the colors will be changed. If you visited www.mozilla.org, the colors would not be changed because the subdomain is "www", not "developer".

Mousing over the gray bar at the bottom will open a flyout menu. To clear all saved colors and subdomains, click Clear Data. Always On will automatically change colors of new tabs. There also happens to be a donate button down there. :)

About the color wheel:
Colors are less saturated near the center and 100% saturated on the edge. There is a separate swatch to the side that says "0% Sat", meaning 0% saturation or 100% gray.

There is also a lightness slider below the color wheel. 0% is black. 100% is white.
